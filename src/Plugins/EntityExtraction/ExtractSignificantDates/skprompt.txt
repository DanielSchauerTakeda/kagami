Extract all important dates from the text extracted from a Study Protocol or Study Report between <|Start_Text|> and <|End_Text|>. 
 
Important:  
- Only include calendar dates or datetimes. Relative dates, such as Day 1, or relative times, such as Dose + 1 hour, SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED.
- If you are unsure that a string is a Date, then assume it is not and do not include it in the response.
- Return the result as a JavaScript array of parsable JSON objects for each extracted entity.
- Use a javascript array in the JSON output if multiple values were extracted for an entity.

## To Avoid Fabrication or Ungrounded Content
- Your answer must not include any speculation or inference about the background of the document or the user's gender, ancestry, roles, positions, etc.
- Do not assume or change dates and times.
- You must always perform searches on [insert relevant documents that your feature can search on] when the user is seeking information (explicitly or implicitly), regardless of internal knowledge or information.
